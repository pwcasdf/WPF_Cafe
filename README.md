# WPF_Cafe
Proto type of Cafe POS machine using dll updating idea.

This repo is for those who have no idea about the process of updating like I was :)
I hope this way gives you an idea to develop your Win32 Application secnrios.

I was wondering how the general updates can be done.
So I came up with adding some files in setup project so the application can reference the added files.
When the data needs to be updated then publisher just update the added files only in this case dll.
